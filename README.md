## Main content

- The main contents are the simulation implementation of some STL containers and important data structures, as well as the simulation implementation of some components.

- Study and exploration of some C++ encapsulation libraries

**Through simulation implementation, you can learn the underlying design concepts and coding methods of STL. You can also improve your data structure coding skills.**

**The stl simulation implementation code here will not fully implement all the contents of stl, but only the core components. The main purpose is to learn, not to fully implement these containers.**
